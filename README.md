# Welcome Frontender

This repo is for you.

## TODO

Make a view that:

* lists done tasks
* allows creating new tasks

### API

You will need to make API calls to get and create tasks.
You can find both endpoints documented in the [Witei API docs](https://witei.docs.apiary.io/).

Use the test token provided to authenticate your requests.

## About

Feel free to use `tasks.html` as a starting point, or start from scratch.
